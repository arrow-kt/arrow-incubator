## Fix




The fix datatype is the simplest way to model birecursion via a direct encoding of
the `project` and `embed` functions.

```kotlin
@higherkind
data class Fix<out A>(val unfix: Kind<A, Eval<FixOf<A>>>) : FixOf<A>
```

`embed` is isomorphic to the `Fix` constructor, and `project` is isomorphic to `unfix`.

### Comparison to Mu and Nu

If Mu is `A` and Nu is `A?`, then fix is `A!`. Fix provides no information about whether
or not a datatype is infinite, and is generally less safe that Mu or Nu. However, due
to its simplicity, both Recursive and Corecursive instances for fix are very fast.
