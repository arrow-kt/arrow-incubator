## Nu




The Nu datatype is the simplest way to model corecursion via a direct encoding of the
ana function.

```kotlin
@higherkind
class Nu<out F>(val a: Any?, val unNu: Coalgebra<F, Any?>) : NuOf<F>
```

Nu's constructor is isomorphic to ana.

### Comparison to Fix and Nu

Nu warns that a datatype can be be infinite, and should be used for any algorithms
that can work on infinite data (for example `map`). Due to it being a direct encoding
of ana, Nu also has a very fast Corecursive instance.
